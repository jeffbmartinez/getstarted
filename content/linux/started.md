# Get Started with Docker on Linux

This tutorial is intended for users on Linux systems such as Ubuntu. Not your operating system? **You can choose the tutorial for [Mac OS X](/mac/started) or [Windows](/windows/started)**.

This tutorial introduces fundamental Docker features by guiding you through some
simple tasks. It takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

* install Docker
* run a software image in a container
* browse for an image on Docker Hub
* create your own image and run it in a container
* create a Docker Hub account and an image repository
* create an image of your own
* push your image to Docker Hub for others to use

While Docker has a graphical interface called Kitematic, this tutorial uses the
command line which is available on each of Docker's major distribution.
