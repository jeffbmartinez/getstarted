# Get Started with Docker for Windows

**This is written for users of Windows. If you are not using Windows, see the [Linux](/linux/started) or [Mac OS X](/mac/started) version.**

This getting started is for non-technical users who are interested in learning about Docker. By following this getting started, you'll learn fundamental Docker features by performing some simple tasks. You'll learn how to:

* install Docker
* run a software image in a container
* browse for an image on Docker Hub
* create your own image and run it in a container
* create a Docker Hub account and an image repository
* create an image of your own
* push your image to Docker Hub for others to use

The getting started was user tested to reduce the chance of users having problems. For the best chance of success, follow the steps as written the first time before exploring on your own. It takes approximately 45 minutes to complete.


### Make sure you understand...

This getting started uses Docker commands with a terminal window. You don't need
to be experienced using a command line, but you should be familiar with how to
open one and type commands.

Go to [the next page to install](/windows/step_one).
