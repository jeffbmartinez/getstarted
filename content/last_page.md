# Where to go next

You've completed the Docker Getting Started tutorial. You've done a lot, you've:

* installed Docker
* run a software image in a container
* located an interesting image on Docker Hub
* run the image on your own machine
* modified an image to create your own and run it
* create a Docker Hub account and repository
* pushed your image to Docker Hub for others to share

You've only scratched the surface of what Docker can do. To learn more, go onto
to view the  [Docker User Guide](http://docs.docker.com) in our documentation.
