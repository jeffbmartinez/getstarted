# Get Started with Docker for Mac OS X

##### This tutorial is intended for users on Linux systems such as Ubuntu. Not your operating system? You can choose the tutorial for [Linux](/linux/started) or [Windows](/windows/started).

This tutorial introduces fundamental Docker features by guiding you through some
simple tasks. It takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

* install Docker
* run a software image in a container
* browse for an image on Docker Hub
* create your own image and run it in a container
* create a Docker Hub account and an image repository
* create an image of your own
* push your image to Docker Hub for others to use


### Make sure you understand...

This tutorial is a basic tutorial aimed at users entirely new to Docker. It should be comfortable for users who are non-technical and perhaps just investigating Docker.

While Docker has a graphical interface called Kitematic, this tutorial uses the
command line which is available on each of Docker's major distribution. You don't need to be experienced using a command line, but you should have some experience.
