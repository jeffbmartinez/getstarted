# Get Started with Docker

This tutorial introduces fundamental Docker features by walking you through some
simple tasks. These tasks include:

* installing Docker
* running a software image in a container
* browsing for an image on Docker Hub
* creating your own image and running it in a container
* creating a Docker Hub account and repository
* pushing your image to Docker Hub for others to use

While Docker has a graphical interface called Kitematic, this
tutorial uses the command line which is available on every major distribution.
